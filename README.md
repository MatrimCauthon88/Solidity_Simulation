This is an example of a Solidit contract. This contract take three address to split a Cryptocurrency equally among those three addresses. It ensures that he amount is split evenly between three adress, that amount is then transferred to each address, with any remaining amount going back to the sender, and ensure that it is deposited to each address.

This is a simple example fo how smart conracts can be utilized to evenly distribute something of monetary value among individuals. This contrct was first tested on a local network. Once it was successfull on the local network it was deployed to the test network(Kovan) where it was also successfully deployed and used.

Below is a screenshot of the test transaction of the contract being used on the Kovan network. You can also find the contract address here.
